# Keyboards

# Macropad Designs
# I make macropads for fun and for learning.
# Currently there are 3 working models, a 3x3, 2x3 and 4x4 keyswitch only
# models. I am currently coming up with a 2x3 which supports a rotary encoder
# along with a 128x32 pixel OLED LCD screen which can be used to display 
# anything, typically a clock.
